# This file is used to ignore specific commit revision for `git blame`. It
# contains a list of commits that are not likely what you are looking for in a
# blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming. It can be used by any of the
# following ways:
#
# - Include the file in the command:
#      $ git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs <other options>
#
# - Through gitconfig (needs to be set per-project):
#      $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Each commit has to be the full 40 character hash and comments are allowed.
# Required git version: 2.23

# Format the entire codebase through black (PR #162)
